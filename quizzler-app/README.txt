Quizzler app is an quiz application that can be used to learn and compete with peers as hot-seat game.

Quizler game project was used as a practise to learn more about API requests and creating reactive UI.
Have fun using it and coping needed parts.

The whole project was inspired by Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023", Udemy
course.
